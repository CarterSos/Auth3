    <h4>
        Fag el-Gamous (which means Way of the Water Buffalo) is a large and important cemetery
        in Egypt that has been under archeological investigation (primarily by BYU researchers)
        for over 25 years. The excavation has garnered international attention because of the
        interesting insights gained by studying the Fag el-Gamous mummies.

    <h4>
        During multiple years of study, researchers have excavated more than 1,000 mummies and
        collected data in field notes, spreadsheets, and simple databases about each mummy’s location,
        physical orientation in the ground, burial depth, hair color, wrapping (including information
        about the textiles used), sex, age, bone (including skull and teeth) dimensions, items
        accompanying the mummy, and more.
